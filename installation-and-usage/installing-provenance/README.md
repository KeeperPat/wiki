# Installing Provenance

To install Provenance or update your existing installation follow one of the official guides below.

* ⬇️  [**Installing**](./#installing-alt) · initial installation
* 🔄  [**Updating**](updating.md) · update existing installation

### Installing <a id="installing-alt"></a>

There are two approved methods to install Provenance: The easiest or less technical method is to _sideload_ an official prebuilt `.ipa` file to your device\(s\). The more advanced method \(generally developers, contributors, testers…\) is to _build from source_ directly to your device\(s\).

**Installation Options:**

* ⤵️  [**Sideloading**](sideloading.md) · using _official_ pre-built .ipa
* ▶️  [**Building**](building-from-source.md) · from latest source

{% hint style="info" %}
**Requires** _free_ [Apple Developer](https://9to5mac.com/2016/03/27/how-to-create-free-apple-developer-account-sideload-apps/) account, at a minimum. _Free_ account provisioning expires _every 7 days_, requiring reloading/rebuilding, but you will not lose any data.

_Paid_ Apple Developer provisioning may only require re-signing once a year.
