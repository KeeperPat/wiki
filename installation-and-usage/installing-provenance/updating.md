# Updating

When there is a new release or recent commits to a source branch you have a few options for updating. You can _sideload_ a prebuild over your existing sideloaded installation or you can _pull_ the local source and build over your existing built-from-source installation. _**New:**_ Update & Build via `make` \(untested\).

**Update Options:**

* ‚§µÔ∏è¬† [**Sideload**](sideloading.md)\*\*\*\*
* üîÉ¬† [**Pull**](updating.md#pull) latest changes using‚Ä¶

   * Stash Changes: If want to reapply your changes to source files \(especially any PRs you are working on or simply your Bundle IDs App Groups\), you will need to stash and re-apply them with:

## Update & Build

If you've already done the First-time Setup, then you can build from the command-line using the following commands. These commands will pull any updates and build, so you can opt to update and build using only the terminal in the future.

* **iOS \(iPhone, iPad\):**

  ```bash
    make ios
  ```

* **tvOS \(Apple TV\):**

  ```bash
    make tvos
  ```
